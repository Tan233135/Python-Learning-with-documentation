'''Write a python program to find the remainder when a number 
is devided by z.'''

# Taking input from the user

a = int(input("Enter the number: "))
z = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))

# Finding the remainder using modulus operator

print(f"The ramainder when {a} is devided by {z} is: {a % z}")
