'''Set is also a data structure in python. It is an unordered
collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplicates) 
and must be immutable (cannot be changed). However, a set 
itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it. 
The set class in python is based on the mathematical concept 
of a set. It is a collection of distinct objects,
considered as an object in its own right.'''
