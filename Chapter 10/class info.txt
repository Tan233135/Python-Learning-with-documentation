Class is the blueprint for creating an object.

     |class| -----> Object instantation -----> |object|

       v
  contains info to create
  a valid object
  

  
syntax: 

class Employee: Class name is written in pascal case
         Methods & Variables




An object is an instantation of a class. When class is
defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only
after object instantation.

Objects of a given class can invoke the methods available to it 
without revealing the implementation detailed to the user. --> Abstraction & Encapsulation




Modeling a problem in OOPS:

We identify the following in our problem.
Noun --> Class --> Employee
Adjective --> Attributes --> name,age,salary
Verbs --> Methods --> getSalary(), increment()



Class attributes: An attribute that belongs to the class rather than a 
particular object.
